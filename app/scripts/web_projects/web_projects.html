      <h3 class="app">This Resume!</h3>
      <p>This resume was invaluable for me to improve my skills as it teached me all about the flow of bringing a single page application from development all the way to production.</p>
      <p>I learned all about many different tools such as <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> which helped me automate a series of tasks in development, like image-minification, browserify, watchify, uglify and others.</p>
      <p>I learned how in angular the controller communicates with a view. How a service communicates with a controller and how a service communicates with a server.<p>
